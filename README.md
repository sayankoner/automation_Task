This project uses Selenium WebDriver with Java to perform browser-based automation testing. It includes tests for various features of a sample web application to ensure its proper functionality across different browsers.

The project is built using the following key components:
- **JUnit/TestNG** as the test framework for organizing and running the test cases.
- **Maven/Gradle** as the build automation tool to manage dependencies and build the project.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for creating test scripts.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used to write test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Browser automation framework.
- **Maven/Gradle**: Dependency management and build tool.
- **Log4j**: Logging utility (optional).
- **ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver**: Browser drivers for testing with Chrome and Firefox.

Test Reports
The test reports and logs are generated in the reports directory after execution. These include:

HTML Report: A detailed report showing the pass/fail status of the tests.
Logs: System logs are generated during the test execution.
